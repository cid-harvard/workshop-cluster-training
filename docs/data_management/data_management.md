- Backups
    - Cluster data often backed up, but ensure backup frequency is sufficient
    - Solution: external hard drive (local) + CrashPlan (cloud)
- File organization and naming
    - Create a shared system, *follow it*.
    - Consider date conventions (YYYY-MM-DD), special characters, versioning
- Documentation (README files)
    - Too much documentation > not enough documentation
    - Document your system aka provide orientation documents
    - Template
        - Title
        - Source with link
        - Added by (project user with email)
        - Date added
        - Description
        - Codebook
        - Limitations
        - Other notes
    - Other aspects: Licensing, citation, ethical restrictions, legal restrictions, funder requirements
- Data security
    - IRB where required
    - Don't take data off cluster, especially if sensitive
- Responsibility
    - Assign explicit responsibilities within your project for data management

### Checklist

- At a minimum, follow the checklist available at page 17 (Appendix A) of [ICPSR's booklet](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/files/datamanagement/DataManagementPlans-All.pdf)
- Consider the slightly more detailed project start-and-end [checklists from MIT](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fpj88gzwz291aec/Handout_dataMgmtChecklist.pdf?dl=0)
- Tool available for Data Management Planning: [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org). Note that you don't have to "submit" the data management plan to a funder through DMPTool unless you're explicitly asked to by the funder.
