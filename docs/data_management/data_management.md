# Project Data Management

## Essentials[^1]

- Backups
    - Cluster data often backed up, but ensure backup frequency is sufficient
    - Solution: external hard drive (local) + CrashPlan (cloud)
- File organization and naming
    - Create a shared system, *follow it*.
    - Consider date conventions (YYYY-MM-DD), special characters, versioning
- Documentation (README files)
    - Too much documentation > not enough documentation
    - Document your system aka provide orientation documents
    - Template:

```markdown
Title

Data Source with link

Added by (CID member's name with email)

Dates:
    - Data time period
    - Date added
    - Date modified (if required)

Description

Variable descriptions (incl keys to join with other data)

Limitations

Other notes (such as licensing, citation, ethical restrictions,
             legal restrictions, funder requirements, etc.)

```

- Data security
    - All researchers working with Human Subjects are required to get [IRB ethics training](https://cuhs.harvard.edu/required-ethics-training)
    - [IRB](https://cuhs.harvard.edu) review where required
    - Don't take data off cluster, especially if sensitive
- Responsibility
    - Assign explicit responsibilities within your project for data management

- Read the detailed version of the above checklist adapted from MIT Libraries' [resources](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fpj88gzwz291aec/Handout_dataMgmtChecklist.pdf?dl=0)
- Another good checklist available at page 17 (Appendix A) of [ICPSR's booklet](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/files/datamanagement/DataManagementPlans-All.pdf)
- Tool available for Data Management Planning: [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org). Note that you don't have to "submit" the data management plan to a funder through DMPTool unless you're explicitly asked to by the funder.
