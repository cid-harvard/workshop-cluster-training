## Workshop on Effective Cluster Usage

When: Wednesday, March 27, 2019. 3-4 PM
Where: Perkins

Pre-requisites:
- You should have an account on the [RCE Cluster](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/). If you do not have an account, look at [_Accessing the RCE_](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/book/accessing-rce-0) for instructions on how to obtain one.
- You should be able to login to the cluster using the graphical client [instructions here](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/nx4)
- If you're using Windows, download and install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
- Download and install [FileZilla](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/book/installing-filezilla)
    + If you can follow the instructions [here](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/book/configuring-filezilla), go ahead and configure FileZilla.
    + Don't bother with the configuration if you don't want to, we'll do it at the session again.
- Download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    + If you already know how to, go ahead and install the following packages for Atom:
        - remote-ftp
        - language-stata
- If you want to use Python at any point, download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
