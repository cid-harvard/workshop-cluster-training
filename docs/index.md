### Pre-requisites

Please perform the following steps **before the workshop**, in the interest of time. You can stop by my desk at any point before the workshop if you need help with these:

- You should have an account on the [RCE Cluster](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/). If you do not have an account, look at [Accessing the RCE](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/book/accessing-rce-0) for instructions on how to obtain one.
- You should be able to login to the cluster using the graphical client [instructions here](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/nx4)

- If you're on a Mac, download and install [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
- Download and install [FileZilla](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/book/installing-filezilla)
    + If you can follow the instructions [here](https://rce-docs.hmdc.harvard.edu/book/configuring-filezilla), go ahead and configure FileZilla.
